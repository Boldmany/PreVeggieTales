split information for one object by "/" and add a new line for a new object

There will be a list of commands, you do not need to include all of them and you dont have to call them in order
(if you dont include them it will be set to 0 or false)


First: type "laser" or "disk" for the respective object you want to create along with the frame to spawn it

If "laser"

	"coord"
	double x coordiante
	double y coordinate

	"vec"
	double x velocity
	double y velocity

	"width"
	double width

	"height"
	double height

	"delay"
	int how long the warning should last

	"lifeSpan"
	int how long the laser should last

	"dir"
	int the direction(1:top to bottom, 2:right to left, 3:bottom to top, 4:left to right)

If disk

	"coord"
	double x coordiante
	double y coordinate
	
	"vec"
	double x velocity
	double y velocity

	"maxSpeed"
	double max speed in the x direction
	double max speed in the y direction

	"finalRadius"
	double final radius
	double how much the radius should increase every frame(set this to 0 if you want it to be the same instantly)
	
	"circularMotion"
	double the degree in the circle you start at
	double the amount of degrees you change every frame
	double x coordinate of the circular path
	double y coordinate of the circular path
	double raius of the circular path

	"delay"
	int how long the warning should last

	"lifeSpan"
	int how long the disk should last	

	"safe"(this will automatically set it to true)

	"showSafe" (lets say you want to show that the there will be a smaller safe circle in the 
	larger one just use this and see what happens)

	"redirect"(this will automatically set it to true, then use the commands under to redirect it)

		"vec"
		double x velocity
		double y velocity

		"maxSpeed"
		double max speed in the x direction
		double max speed in the y direction

		"degreeChange"
		double the amount of degrees you change every frame

		"lifeSpan"
		int how long the disk should last

		"radiusChange"
		double how much the radius will change every frame

		"redirect"(this will automatically set it to true, recursion)
