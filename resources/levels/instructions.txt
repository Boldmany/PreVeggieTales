There will be a list of commands, you do not need to include all of them and you dont have to call them in order
(if you dont include them it will be set to 0 or false)

If there is a space between things in this document, it means you need to write it on a new line
Otherwise right it on the same line split by a "/"

Commands: length, checkpoint, shake, laser, disk

If "length"
	int how long the level is in frames

If "checkpoint"
	int the frame the checkpoint is at

If "shake"
	int the frame it will start shaking
	double the degree of the shake	

If "laser"
	int the frame it will spawn at

	"coord"
	double x coordiante
	double y coordinate

	"vec"
	double x velocity
	double y velocity

	"width"
	double width

	"height"
	double height

	"delay"
	int how long the warning should last

	"lifeSpan"
	int how long the laser should last

	"dir"
	int the direction(1:top to bottom, 2:right to left, 3:bottom to top, 4:left to right)

If "disk"
	int the frame it will spawn at

	"coord"
	double x coordiante
	double y coordinate
	
	"vec"
	double x velocity
	double y velocity

	"maxSpeed"
	double max speed in the x direction
	double max speed in the y direction

	"finalRadius"
	double final radius
	double how much the radius should increase every frame(set this to 0 if you want it to be the same instantly)
	
	"circularMotion"
	double the degree in the circle you start at
	double the amount of degrees you change every frame
	double x coordinate of the circular path
	double y coordinate of the circular path
	double radius of the circular path
	double how much you decrease the radius by every frame 	

	"delay"
	int how long the warning should last

	"lifeSpan"
	int how long the disk should last

	"safe"(this will automatically set it to true)

	"showSafe" (lets say you want to show that the there will be a smaller safe circle in the 
	larger one, just use this and see what happens)

	"redirect"(this will automatically set it to true, then use the commands under to redirect it)

		"vec"
		double x velocity
		double y velocity

		"maxSpeed"
		double max speed in the x direction

		"towardsCenter"
		double how much you decrease the radius of the circular path
		by every frame

		"redirect"(this will automatically set it to true, recursion)
