split information for one object by "/" and add a new line for a new object
Note: type "true" or "false" for boolean demands

First: type "laser" or "disk" for the respective object you want to create

If "laser"
	int for the frame this should spawn at
	double x coordinate
	double y coordinate
	double x velocity
	double y velocity
	double the max speed in the x direction before changing x direction(put 0 if you want it to move left or right)
	double the max speed in the y direction before changing y direction(put 0 if you want it to move up or down)
	double width
	double hight
	int how long the warning should last
	int how long the laser should last(if until collision, set this to 0)

If disk
	
	If The previous disk has redirect as true, do the following:
	double x velocity
	double y velocity
	double the max speed in the x direction before changing x direction(put 0 if you want it to move left or right)
	double the max speed in the y direction before changing y direction(put 0 if you want it to move up or down)
	int how long the disk should last(if until collision, set this to 0)
	boolean redirect
	
	If The previous disk has redirect as false do the following or if this is the first disk you are making:
	int for the frame this should spawn at
	double x coordinate
	double y coordinate
	double x velocity
	double y velocity
	double the max speed in the x direction before changing x direction(put 0 if you want it to move left or right)
	double the max speed in the y direction before changing y direction(put 0 if you want it to move up or down)
	double final radius
	double radius change(if you want it to instantly be the same size as the final radius, set this to 0, but if you have a delay, set this to the radius of the circle for )
	int how long the warning should last
	int how long the disk should last(if until collision, set this to 0)
	boolean whether the circle is a safe zone or not

	boolean redirect (the instructions will be covered over the next few lines)
		becuase I suck at coding this is the best I can do
		Assume you want to change the direction of a this traveling disk mid way, you cant
		but here is how you can
		set the life span to how far you want it to travel
		so once it dies, spawn a new one ontop of it with new velocities
		smart...

Note: this doesn't have to be in oreder of spawn time, I will do that in the code, just remeber that 
redirected disks should come one after the other.

Just try to make the spawn times in order for future editing conveniences
